OSE Workbench Platform Documenation
===================================
A platform for workbench development by `Open Source Ecology <https://www.opensourceecology.org/>`_.

OSE defines a "workbench" as a set of tools in CAD software to design and make a particular machine.

The following pages describe the standards and guidelines for implementing OSE Workbenches using the FreeCAD platform, including structure, patterns for solving common problems, branching and workflow strategy, and versioning.

Every OSE workbench should follow these standards and guidelines to make working between various workbenches easier, and increase collaboration.
