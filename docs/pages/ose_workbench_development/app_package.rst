App Package
===========
The ``app`` package, located within the `base package <base_package.html>`_, contains code for the geometry of parts, and how those parts relate to each other.

The "geometry of parts" is defined as:

* Geometric primitives that make up parts such as vertexes, edges, and faces
* Basic shapes such as boxes, circles, cones, and cylinders
* and operations on, or between these primitives and basic shapes such as `extrusion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrusion>`_, `chamfer <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamfer>`_, `union <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(set_theory)>`_, `difference <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complement_(set_theory)>`_, or `intersection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)>`_

For a formal introduction to these concepts, see `Solid modeling <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_modeling>`_, `Constructive solid geometry <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_solid_geometry>`_, and `Boundary representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_representation>`_.

FreeCAD exposes the ability to define and manipulate the geometry of parts through it's `Part module <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Part_Module>`_.

See the FreeCAD Wiki on `Creating and manipulating geometry <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Manual:Creating_and_manipulating_geometry>`_, and `Topological data scripting <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Topological_data_scripting>`_ for additional details.
