Repository Scope and Naming
===========================
.. admonition:: Motivation

   Provide a uniform catalog of OSE workbenches.

As dicussed in `Workbench Planning: Deciding on a Machine <../workbench_planning/deciding_on_a_machine.html>`_, workbenches should generally be centered around **one** OSE machine in the `Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set>`_.

Each workbench should have a single `Git repository <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git>`_ hosted on a centralized, publicly available, free platform like `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_.

Repository Naming Convention
----------------------------
OSE workbench repository names should be in **all lower-case letters** with dashes ``-`` delimiting spaces, following the pattern ``ose-<machine>-workbench``.

For example, the OSE workbench repository for power cubes should be named ``ose-power-cube-workbench``.

Note, the machine name is in **singular** form.
