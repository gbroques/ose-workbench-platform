Contributing as a Non Programmer
================================
Every task in planning and preparing for OSE workbench development can be done by a non-programmer (i.e. someone who doesn't know how to code).

The goal of this page is to outline what some of these tasks are:

* Start with individual parts
* Break down parts
* Design CAD
* Design Icons
* Define relationship between parts
