Deciding on a Machine
=====================
OSE Workbenches should generally be centered around **one** OSE machine in the `Global Village Construction Set (GVCS) <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set>`_.

Examples of OSE machines in the GVCS include:

* `Tractors <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/LifeTrac>`_
* `Compressed Earth Brick (CEB) Presses <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/CEB_Press>`_
* `Power Cubes <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/Power_Cube>`_
* and `3D Printers <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/3D_Printer>`_

The first step in workbench planning is deciding on the machine the workbench will be focused on.

The goal of an OSE workbench should be to stream-line the design of machine variants.

Amount of Allowed Variation
---------------------------
The balance between how much variation the workbench allows in the design of a machine is a delicate one.

On the one hand, the value of a workbench is it's *strictness* in variation based on what OSE has tested and discovered works best in practice.

On the other hand, the value of a workbench is allowing people to deviate from the "standard design" to create a design suited to their unique needs.

Related Machines
----------------
Depending on which machine the workbench focuses on, there may be *related* machines.

For example, the Tractor includes a Power Cube as it's primary energy source.

These relationships need to be considered carefully in the initial workbench development planning phase.

In the above example, it would be wise to create a **Power Cube Library** that *both* the Tractor and Power Cube workbenches rely on.

Next Step
---------
Once the machine is decided, you must `break down the machine into individual parts <breaking_down_a_machine_into_parts.html>`_.
