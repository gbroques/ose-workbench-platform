Designing Icons
===============
Once the `machine is broken down into parts <breaking_down_a_machine_into_parts.html>`_, icons representing each part can be designed.

See `FreeCAD Wiki: Artwork Guidelines <https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Artwork_Guidelines>`_ for recommendations on how to design the icons.

Once designed, add the icons to the `OSE FreeCAD Icons <https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/OSE_FreeCAD_Icons>`_ page for documentation purposes.

If you lack a designer, or desire to create icons, then you may *temporarily* `use existing FreeCAD icons <https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/tree/master/src/Gui/Icons>`_ that adhere to FreeCAD Artwork Guidelines.

However, this approach is not recommended for a long-term solution, and care must be taken to design appropriate icons for each part that are distinct from other icons in the FreeCAD UI.
