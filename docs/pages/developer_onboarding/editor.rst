.. admonition:: Is VS Code open-source?

   `Explained by a VS Code developer <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60#issuecomment-161792005>`_:

      When we set out to open source our code base, we looked for common practices to emulate for our scenario. We wanted to deliver a Microsoft branded product, built on top of an open source code base that the community could explore and contribute to.
      
      We observed a number of branded products being released under a custom product license, while making the underlying source code available to the community under an open source license. For example, Chrome is built on Chromium, the Oracle JDK is built from OpenJDK [...] Those branded products come with their own custom license terms, but are built on top of a code base thatâ€™s been open sourced.
      
      We then follow a similar model for Visual Studio Code. We build on top of the vscode code base we just open sourced and we release it under a standard, pre-release Microsoft license.

VSCodium
--------
For open-source purists, you may be interested in the MIT-licensed `VSCodium <https://vscodium.com/>`_ as a VS Code alternative.
